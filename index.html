     <h1> Roy Orbison</h1>
      <p>Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician known for his impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. His music was described by critics as operatic, earning him the nicknames "the Caruso of Rock" and "the Big O." Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers chose to project defiant masculinity. He performed while standing motionless and wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses, which he wore to counter his shyness and stage fright.

    <h3>AREA OF EXPERTISE</h3>
    <p>Orbison was born on April 23, 1936 in Vernon, Texas[1] the middle son of nurse Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 – May 12, 1992) and Orbie Lee Orbison (1913-1984), an oil-well driller and car mechanic.[2] According to The Authorized Roy Orbison, the family moved to Fort Worth in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.[3] He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School[3] there until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon.
